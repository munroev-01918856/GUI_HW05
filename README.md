## Problems
Everything in rubric is fully implemented, the only parts not implemented are the tile & board images. Instead tiles are set as in-block but just rest against the webpage backgound below the board. The board is a set of 15 html elements with double word & letter tiles that are droppable components (the lack of board image was approved by TA Tim Trong).

None of the extra credit was implemented.

##Working 

Everything else is working, tiles are draggable only to the active location. Once they are dropped into an active board location the program grabs the letter value & character (and displays to user).User can reset the game and after a word is submitted the board is cleared.
